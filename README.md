## Question 1

Instantiate a new Angular module called `BlogPost` that takes `ui.router` as a dependency. Use Angular code style conventions.

**Your answer:**
```js
"use strict";

(function(){
  angular
  .module("BlogPost",[
    "ui.router"
  ])
}());
```

## Question 2

Given a custom directive whose `link` function contains the line:

```js
scope.status = "Click";
```

Which *one* of the following buttons would *not* be displayed?

```html
[ ] A: <button data-ng-if="status">Click</button>
[ ] B: <button data-ng-show="status">Click</button>
[ ] C: <button data-ng-hide="status">Click</button>
[X] D: <button>{{status}}</button>
```

## Question 3

One button below has an `ng-click` attribute; the other has `data-ng-click` instead. What difference does it make?

```html
<button ng-click="create()">Click</button>
<button data-ng-click="create()">Click</button>
```

**Your answer:**
'data-ng-click' will not throw an error in an HTML validator, whereas 'ng-click' won't validate, as 'data-' before the attribute name tells the HTML validator to ignore that attribute. There is no functional difference between the two of them.

## Question 4

Which of the following demonstrates the best usage of `ng-app`? **Explain your answer.**

**Your answer:**
A, because the html tag is a reasonable place to put ng-app – it's the outter wrapper, so inheritance works as intended – placing it in the head tag would mean that directives could only be used in the head, which doesn't make much sense. In answer C, the app needs to be defined in a tag that wraps around the ui-sref directive, as it depends on the ui.router injection in the app.
> ...

### A:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html data-ng-app="myapp">
  <head>
    <title>My app</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1><a data-ui-sref="index">My App</a></h1>
    <div></div>
  </body>
</html>
```

### B:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head data-ng-app="myapp">
    <title>My app</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1><a data-ui-sref="index">My App</a></h1>
    <div></div>
  </body>
</html>
```

### C:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My app</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1><a data-ui-sref="index">My App</a></h1>
    <div data-ng-app="myapp"></div>
  </body>
</html>
```

## Question 5

Imagine an app in which a change to the view updates the model without a page refresh, and a change to the model updates the view without a page refresh.

Which one of the following concepts does this best illustrate?

```
[ ] A: Modularity
[ ] B: MVC
[X] C: Two-way data-binding
[ ] D: Separation of concerns
```

## Question 6

What is an IIFE, and why might you use it?

**Your answer:**
It's an immediately invoked function expression, which is a function that does exactly what it says and invokes itself. We use IIFEs to encapsulate variables, functions, etc within a function so that we don't have to deal with lots of global variables.

## Question 7

What is the `ui-sref` directive, and how is it used?

**Your answer:**
It's a directive in the ui.router.state submodule of ui.router that refers to the state, and if the state has a URL, it automatically grabs it – it's used to create a link that, when clicked, takes the user to a specific view without reloading the page.

## Question 8

One of the lines of code in the following snippet will throw an error. Which one is it, and why?

**Your answer:**
Because the variable 'i' isn't defined as "var i" in line three, it will cause this code snippet to throw an error.
> ...

```js
/*1*/ "use strict";
/*2*/ var max = 100;
/*3*/ for(i = 1; i < max; i++){
/*4*/   if(i % 15 == 0) console.log("FizzBuzz");
/*5*/   else if(i % 3 == 0) console.log("Fizz");
/*6*/   else if(i % 5 == 0) console.log("Buzz");
/*7*/   else console.log(i);
/*8*/ }
```

## Question 9

Custom directives can be embedded in HTML four different ways. Demonstrate **two** of these four with a directive called `my-directive`. (Hint: "MACE")

**Your answer:**
```html
As custom directives can be embedded as a comment, attribute, class or element, and these are examples of the last two, respectively:

<div class="custom-directive"></div>
<custom-directive></custom-directive>
```

## Question 10

Of the three following options, which is the most "correct" way of organizing the files that make up an Angular app? Why is this option considered "better" than the other two?

**Your answer:**
B is considered the 'better' way currently, as the convention is to organize files by the model they refer to, rather than by the type of file.
