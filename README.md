**Your answer:**

## Question 2

Given a custom directive whose `link` function contains the line:

```js
scope.status = "Click";
```

Which *one* of the following buttons would *not* be displayed?

```html
[ ] A: <button data-ng-if="status">Click</button>

One button below has an `ng-click` attribute; the other has `data-ng-click` instead. What difference does it make?

```html
<button ng-click="create()">Click</button>
<button data-ng-click="create()">Click</button>
```

**Your answer:**

> ...

data-ng-click runs fine in HTML validator
ng-click will not validate it
both work perfectly fine though

## Question 4

Which of the following demonstrates the best usage of `ng-app`? **Explain your answer.**

**Your answer:**

> ...

answer a. it places it on the entire html file, normally you place controllers on the body and divs but you never place ng custom directives on the head.

### A:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html data-ng-app="myapp">
  <head>
    <title>My app</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1><a data-ui-sref="index">My App</a></h1>
    <div></div>
  </body>
</html>
```

### B:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head data-ng-app="myapp">
    <title>My app</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1><a data-ui-sref="index">My App</a></h1>
    <div></div>
  </body>
</html>
```

### C:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My app</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1><a data-ui-sref="index">My App</a></h1>
    <div data-ng-app="myapp"></div>
  </body>
</html>
```

```

## Question 8

One of the lines of code in the following snippet will throw an error. Which one is it, and why?

**Your answer:**

> ...
the if else statements seem to be off and need curly brackets for console.logs.
```js
/*1*/ "use strict";
/*2*/ var max = 100;
/*3*/ for(i = 1; i < max; i++){
/*4*/   if(i % 15 == 0) console.log("FizzBuzz");
/*5*/   else if(i % 3 == 0) console.log("Fizz");
/*6*/   else if(i % 5 == 0) console.log("Buzz");
/*7*/   else console.log(i);
/*8*/ }
```

## Question 9

Custom directives can be embedded in HTML four different ways. Demonstrate **two** of these four with a directive called `my-directive`. (Hint: "MACE")

**Your answer:**
```html
<div class = "quiezzzz" ng-controller="my-directive"></div>
<html data-ng-app="my-directive"></html>

```

## Question 10

Of the three following options, which is the most "correct" way of organizing the files that make up an Angular app? Why is this option considered "better" than the other two?

**Your answer:**

> ...
A seems the most semantic to me. controllers and directives are always js files so they do not belong in views and all the views are inside their own folder. Even if b and c was the best way to organize I would probably have a workflow like A.

### A:
```
/js
  app.js
  controllers/
    artist_index.js
    artist_show.js
  directives/
    artist_form.js
    song_form.js
  views/
    artist_index.html
    artist_show.html
    artist_form.html
    song_form.html
```

### B:
```
/js
  app.js
  artists/
    index.controller.js
    index.html
    show.controller.js
    show.html
    form.directive.js
    form.html
  songs/
    form.html
    form.directive.html
```

### C:
```
/js
  app.js
  controllers/
    artists_controller.js
  directives/
    songs_directive.js
/html
  artists/
    index.html
    show.html
    form.html
  songs/
    form.html
```
